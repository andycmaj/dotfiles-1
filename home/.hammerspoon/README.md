# My Hammerspoon config


## [winman.lua](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.hammerspoon/winman.lua)

Awesome window management. My goal is being able to do as much as possible while memorizing as few hotkeys as possible. `⌃⌥⌘` + `hjkl` allow me to easily organize windows in halves and thirds.

Shortcut | Effect
-------- | --------------------------------------------------------
**⌃⌥⌘K** | Grow and shrink windows while keeping them at the top
**⌃⌥⌘J** | Grow and shrink windows while keeping them at the bottom
**⌃⌥⌘H** | Grow and shrink windows while keeping them to the left
**⌃⌥⌘L** | Grow and shrink windows while keeping them to the right
**⌃⌥⌘←** | Move windows left
**⌃⌥⌘→** | Move windows right 
**⌃⌥⌘↑** | Move windows up
**⌃⌥⌘↓** | Move windows down
**⌃⌥⌘.** | Snap windows to the grid
**⌃⌥⌘,** | Cascade windows
**⌃⌥⌘;** | Fill screen with current window
**⌃⌥⌘O** | Show a stripe of the Desktop



## [slowq.lua](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.hammerspoon/slowq.lua)

Never quit an app by accident again. Replaces apps like [CommandQ](https://clickontyler.com/commandq/) and [SlowQuitApps](https://github.com/dteoh/SlowQuitApps).


## [readline.lua](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.hammerspoon/readline.lua)

Expands the [readline keybindings](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bindable-Readline-Commands.html) already [available on macOS](https://jblevins.org/log/kbd).


## [vim.lua](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.hammerspoon/vim.lua)

Vim keybindings and modes everywhere. Although it works pretty well, I found this a little too gimmicky and ended up disabling it for myself, so it's not something I'll be updating constantly.


## [clipboard.lua](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.hammerspoon/clipboard.lua)

My attempt at a minimalistic clipboard management solution. Even more minimalistic, however, is no clipboard management at all, so I ended up disabling this too. It worked alright while I used it though.
